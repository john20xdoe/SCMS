    <h2>Reports Generation</h2>
    <p><img src="images/report.jpg" alt="" />You can generate reports based on the information you have stored in SCMS. There are (for now) two ways to do this.</p>
    <p>One is by selecting report templates (click <b>Templates</b> from the side menu).</p>
    <p>The other is by using <b title="By Chris Coyier (css-tricks.com)">Printliminator&trade;</b>, which can be found at the bottom left of every page.
    You can use Printliminator&trade; to print any SCMS page!</p>
